Last week GroundUp published a video, shot on 17 May, of Bering Street in KwaNobuhle, Kariega (formerly Uitenhage).
We asked: Is this the most disgusting street in South Africa?
On Wednesday, as our new video above shows, the municipality cleaned the street.
But some readers told us they knew of streets as dirty as this one.
We were too sheepish to ask what happened to the pigs.
