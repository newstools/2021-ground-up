Economist for the Helen Suzman Foundation, Charles Simkins, has written four short easy pieces analysing the state of the South African health system. This comes at a vital time, as we battle the Covid-19 pandemic and government remains committed to National Health Insurance. Each of the pieces is linked to a more technical in-depth version that may interest researchers.

Part one: Workers’ compensation and the Road Accident Fund
Part two: How well are municipalities doing?
Part three: How much are we spending on health?
Part four: How will the health system cope for the next four years?
