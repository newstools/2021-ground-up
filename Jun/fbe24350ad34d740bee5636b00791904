Three vehicles were set alight in Govan Mbeki Road, Philippi, in Cape Town on Tuesday during a taxi drivers’ protest which started last Thursday.
Protesting taxi drivers are demanding that City of Cape Town Traffic Service return 56 vehicles that were impounded.
Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said on Monday three vehicles had been set alight. Since the protest started ten vehicles and one Golden Arrow bus had been burnt, he said.
Swartbooi said on Tuesday morning that another operation was also conducted where 30 vehicles were impounded.
Mayco Member for Safety and Security JP Smith said the operations were in response to complaints about the behavior of taxis and particularly amaphela operators in Nyanga. He said that the vehicles of public transport drivers found without an operating licence or operating contrary to the conditions of their licence would be impounded.
JP Smith said any public transport vehicle that is impounded could be reclaimed after the driver or owner had paid the fine and a release fee.
The owner of a delivery truck that was set alight, Mohamed Ibrahim, said his brother had been driving the vehicle.
Ibrahim said about 30 men had come between the shacks not far from Philippi Plaza and forced his brother out of the vehicle. “They took his two phones and money. The truck had stock. They looted it before stoning the truck and setting it alight,” said Ibrahim.
He said his brother was not harmed.
Smith said traffic enforcement efforts would continue.
Swartbooi said cases of public violence were being investigated
