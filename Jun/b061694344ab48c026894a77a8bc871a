To help people in a rural Western Cape area to get vaccinated against Covid-19, UNICEF is using a truck to register people on the government’s EVDS system. The truck is also raising vaccine awareness.
When this video was shot fewer than half of people over 60 in South Africa were registered on the government system.
While this is a great initiative, it does raise the question: why not simply vaccinate people at the same time as registering them?
