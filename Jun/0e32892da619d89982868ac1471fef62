Community leader Sakhumzi Kakaza (above) moved to Siqalo informal settlement in 2011 when it was established. He says floods make the roads impassable for vehicles whenever there are heavy rains.

Siqalo informal settlement is located next to Mitchells Plain and is now home to about 2,000 people. Siqalo means ‘the beginning’ in Xhosa. 

Children play during a lull in the rain on Tuesday. Further rain is expected this week.
In a statement, Mayco Member for Safety and Security JP Smith said that structures have been affected by flooding in numerous areas, including Gugulethu, Wynberg, Valhalla Park, Khayelitsha, Hout Bay, Masiphumulele and Overcome Heights.
“The City’s Transport Department is providing sand and milling where it is possible to do so (but note that milling is not a solution in many of the waterlogged areas) and SASSA has been informed to assist with humanitarian relief,“ the statement said.
